#### Improvements

- perf(core): `memGetAddress`/`memPutAddress` are now an order of magnitude faster on 32-bit JVMs.
- perf(core): Optimized pointer arithmetic by helping the JVM identify unsigned integers.
- perf(core): The new `java.util.Objects` index check intrinsics are used on Java 9.
- perf(core): `MemoryUtil` string decoding methods are now faster on both Java 8 and 9+.
    * The Java 9 implementations are tuned for compact strings ([JEP 254](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/254)).
- perf(generator):  Function pointers in capabilities classes are not sorted by name anymore.
    * This makes it more likely that for functions that are commonly used together, their respective pointers
    will be closer in memory, avoiding unnecessary cache misses.
- Generator: `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` now includes signatures for known callback functions.
    * Can be used for callback function delegation.
- Generator: Added support for custom methods in struct classes.
- Linux: LWJGL shared libraries are now built with GCC 7 (up from 6)
- Loader: Now prints the path of shared libraries loaded from system paths in debug mode, when possible.

#### Fixes

- Generator: Fixed nullability of macro bindings.
- Generator: Fixed location of generated static blocks
- macOS: Fixed version number detection in `.dylib` name mapping
