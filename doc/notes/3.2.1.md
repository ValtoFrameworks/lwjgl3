### 3.2.1

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Improvements

- bgfx: Builds of bgfx tools (`geometryc`, `shaderc`, `texturec`, `texturev`) are now available.
    * Use the [file browser](https://www.lwjgl.org/browse) in the LWJGL website to download the executables.
    * For example, the latest Windows x64 build of `shaderc` can be found under `nightly/windows/x64/bgfx-tools/`.
- vma: `VmaVulkanFunctions.set(VkInstance, VkDevice)` will now use Vulkan 1.1 functions instead of `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` functions, if available.

#### Fixes

- vma: The native library is now initialized automatically.
- vma: Optional `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` addresses in `VmaVulkanFunctions` are now nullable.
